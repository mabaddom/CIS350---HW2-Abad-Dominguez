* I like learning new coding languages
* I am intrested in game development
* I also just play a lot of games in my free time


## Tecnical Background 

I have experience in python, throughout my first year CIS classes, where we also did projects like our chess game. 
I also have early experience in Linux which I have been learning in CIS 241.
I am currently self-teaching myself Java for our group project in order to get a better understanding of the concepts I already know.
